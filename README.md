## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
-   [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

-   [To force same width on items](https://css-tricks.com/equal-columns-with-flexbox-its-more-complicated-than-you-might-think/), make flex-grow = 1 **AND** flex-basis **must** be reset to 0

```css
.item {
	flex-grow: 1;
	flex-basis: 0;
}
```

- or, use Grid:

```css
.container {
	display: grid;

	/* this specifies direction */
	grid-auto-flow: column;

	/* every [implicit] column is same size */
	grid-auto-columns: 1fr;
}
```
